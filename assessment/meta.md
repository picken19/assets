## Coding scheme

### Software Carpentry Pre-Assessment

* Section A: Scale of scientific computation ability, modified from Libarkin.
5-10 items, depending on what material is covered at a workshop. 1-4 Likert scale, where 1 indicates "high ability" and 4 indicates "low ability"
* Section B: Scale of Python coding ability, modified from Libarkin. Approximately 15 items. 1-4 Likert scale items, where 1 is "strongly agree" and 4 is "strongly disagree."
* Section C: Scale of database ability. 8-9 items. 1-4 Likert scale, where 1 indicates "strongly agree" and 4 indicates "strongly disagree."
* Section D: Open-ended questions about expectations for boot camp and why participant is taking the workshop

### Software Carpentry Post-Assesment
* Same as pre-assessment for Sections A-C
* Section D: Workshop satisfaction, 5-10 questions depending on topics covered at the boot camp. 1-5 Likert scale, where 1 is "very good" and 5 is "very poor."
* Section E: Open-ended questions about comments and suggestions for workshops. Also, questions regarding overall impact, including
	- "How well did this workshop meet your needs?" 1-"very well," 2-"somewhat," 3-"a little," and 4-"not at all"
	- "Did you learn what you hoped to learn from participating in this workshop?" 1-"yes," 2-"no"
	- "Did you understanding of computational science change because of your participation in this workshop?" 1-"yes," 2-"no"
	- "Would you recommend this workshop to your colleagues?" 1-"yes," 2-"no"
	- Open ended: "Please provide any additional suggestions..."
