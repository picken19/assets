# Future ideas for SWC assessment

1. Onsite observation: 
	
	Protocol is already created and needs to be implemented across a series of different boot camps

2. Interview instructors: 
	
	Why do people participate in open source computational science and teaching?

	What at the main benefits?

	What are their goals for teaching?

	What topics do they think are most useful to students?

	What should we teach that we aren't already teaching?
	
	Where/how did they learn computational science?

3. Workflow assessment instrument:

	Develop an assessment that is not tool-specific and instead targets the major ideas/philosophies taught in SWC

	Pilot the instrument and test for reliability/validity

	Use in the long-term to measure scientific productivity and reproducibility
